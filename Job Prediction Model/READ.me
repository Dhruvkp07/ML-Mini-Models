About Dataset
The AI-Driven Resume Screening Dataset is a high-quality synthetic dataset designed to replicate how modern AI-assisted recruitment systems evaluate and shortlist candidates. With the increasing adoption of machine learning in Human Resources, organizations rely on automated screening tools to efficiently analyze resumes, reduce manual effort, and identify suitable candidates based on multiple quantitative and qualitative factors.

This dataset models the end-to-end resume screening process by incorporating key candidate attributes such as professional experience, skills alignment with job requirements, educational background, project exposure, resume quality, and open-source contribution activity. Each feature is logically correlated to reflect real-world hiring patterns rather than random noise, ensuring the data behaves realistically during exploratory analysis and model training.

The target variable, shortlisted, represents the final hiring decision outcome (Yes / No) based on a weighted evaluation of all candidate features. This makes the dataset particularly suitable for binary classification tasks, HR decision modeling, and automated talent screening simulations. Additionally, the dataset can be used to study algorithmic fairness, enabling researchers to examine potential biases related to education level, experience, or technical exposure.

By balancing realism with controllability, this dataset supports a wide range of applications including machine learning model development, feature importance analysis, bias and fairness assessment, and HR analytics research. It is ideal for students, data scientists, and researchers seeking a practical, ethically relevant dataset that aligns with real industry use cases.
