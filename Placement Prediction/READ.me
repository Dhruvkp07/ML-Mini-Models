#About This Project
This project focuses on predicting student placement status ('Placed' or 'Not Placed') using a dataset containing various academic, skill-based, and personal attributes. The goal is to build a robust classification model that can accurately identify students likely to be placed, which can be valuable for career guidance and institutional support.

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The project begins by loading the train.csv and test.csv datasets. Initial exploration involves examining data types, checking for missing values, and summarizing statistical properties of the features.

Feature Engineering: Several new features were engineered to capture more meaningful insights from the raw data:

Academic_Strength: Derived from CGPA and Aptitude_Test_Score.
Experience_Score: Combines Internships and Projects to reflect practical experience.
Skill_Power: A composite score from Coding_Skills, Communication_Skills, and Soft_Skills_Rating.
Risk_Score: Calculated from Backlogs and CGPA to quantify academic risk.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap was generated to visualize the correlations between the numerical features, helping to understand feature relationships and potential multicollinearity.

Data Preprocessing:

Irrelevant columns such as Student_ID, Age, and the original individual skill/academic scores were dropped to streamline the model input.
Categorical features (Gender, Degree, Branch, Placement_Status) were converted into numerical representations using LabelEncoder.
Model Training: An XGBoost Classifier was chosen for its performance and ability to handle complex datasets. The model was trained on the processed training data (X_train, y_train).

Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set (X_test, y_test) using:

Accuracy Score: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 88.63% on the training validation set.
Classification Report: Provided detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for both 'Placed' and 'Not Placed' classes.
Prediction on Test Data: The model was then used to make predictions on the separate test.csv dataset. The accuracy on this unseen test data was approximately 89.18%, demonstrating the model's generalization capabilities.

This project showcases a complete machine learning workflow from data preparation and feature engineering to model training and evaluation, providing a solid foundation for predicting student placement outcomes.
